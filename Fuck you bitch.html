<p>
A sudden knock  broke his dream.  It was heavy  knock but to his
ears  it seemed  only a  gentle tap  of the  back of  the middle
finger. He turned his side and  put the pillow, pressing hard on
his ears. The  knock came back again and if  he hadn’t had drink
that night  he would have heard  a little noise that  came after
the knock.  The  knocks died down when he pressed  the pillow in
sort of way that one would  press on ones mouth who was supposed
to  take the  last breath.   That  what he  murmured, under  the
blanket. Let  me take my last  breath. The knock died  down, and
when Roy  recollected whole  incident the  next morning,  he had
only  heard three  gentle  taps and  nothing  else.  The  scream
before  the  thudd on  the  door  after  nothing. He  was  drunk
alright.
</p>

<p>
The alarm  broke his sleep, he  put his thumb on  the switch and
turned it  off. Then slid under  the warmth of the  blanket, the
haze came back again.
</p>

<p>
The alarm  sounded even louder the  next time, and when  he slid
out  his  hand from  the  blanket,  he  tripped  off it  on  the
floor. The  noise rang louder and  louder. That was the  hell of
the choice for an alarm.  The  low pitch shrill that can wake up
whole flat  at once. He swayed  his arm along the  length of the
bed, and  only he could feel  was the cold marble.   He flinched
his arm and pulled back into the blanket.
</p>

<p>
The haze came back, and then  gone again when alarm didn’t stop.
It was its job.   He threw the blanket on the  side and rose. It
was five  and seven he  looked on the  mobile. He turned  on the
torch and  flashed on  the floor. The  light reflected  over the
shiny rim of the alarm. Why didn’t he threw that away.
</p>

<p>
Roy picked it up and switched  it off. He swinged his arm around
bed without actually losing the grip on the alarm. For moment he
even felt  that the smooth  surface brushed over finger  and the
alarm was  at the  ends of  his finger. And  yet when  the swing
ended, it felt right back in his palm, the coldness.
</p>

<p>
He  turned  on  the  light  and  put  it  beside  his  childhood
photoframe. The  alarm was the  only thing that remained  of the
relationship that he hadn’t crushed down or sent in a tapped box
at Riya’s house. And how bad had that turned out, not exactly as
he expected. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
Roy  turned  on  the  music  on  his  phone  and  got  into  the
bathroom. The booze hadn’t weared off and he could realize while
watching his face in the mirror. The eyes were not red like last
night, but still the pinkish hue  was there to remind him of the
drinks he had the last night.
</p>

<p>
The reason behind  the booze he all remembered  clearly.  It was
just what happened after that  was blurred and hidden behind the
haze. He picked up the brush from  the shelf and put it into his
mouth and sat on the toilet seat.
</p>

<p>
He  tapped  on  the  forehead  for three  times  and  even  then
unsatisfied he  shaked his head to  and fro. It didn’t  help get
off the  hazy images of his  head. Instead his head  fell on his
lap.
</p>

<p>
And when he  woke up, he realized the toothbrush  was barren and
there wasn’t  any paste on  it.  He  removed the brush  from his
mouth and flushed down the toilet. He opened the shelf again and
picked  up  the  toothpaste  and  saw  in  the  corner,  an  old
toothbrush  lying, RIYAS  handwritten on  it. He  picked it  and
threw in the  dustbin below.
</p>

<p>
This was the  last thing of her. And ofcourse  the bloody alarm.
Reminds me the morning and Reminds me mornings with her. It rang
in his mind until he shaked his head again.
</p>

<p>
The taste of the toothpaste seemed  bitter on his tongue, but he
didn’t  care. He  started  moving, not  dancing  he didn’t  like
dancing, to the music. It was  sort of like those kids who can’t
pull their legs up or move  their waist. They just up their arms
in the air and jumps up and down without leaving the floor.
</p>

<p>
The toothpaste did work and the hazy images got off his mind. He
rinsed his  mouth, gargled  for good two  minutes and  wiped his
face.
</p>

<p>
God Damn you bastard He yelled a little. It was like whisper but
in anger.  He  turned Honey Singh off his phone  and got back to
the bed.
</p>

<p>
He jumped on  the bed and lied  down on his back,  his arms wide
open,  his legs  barely touching  the  floor.
</p>

<p>
It was  the daily schedule,  after Riya  had left her.   Wake up
early and  get yourself  running. It was  under control  for two
weeks,  the same  fact  he started  doubting  now. And  suddenly
yesterday evening when he saw Riya  in the cafe taking sips from
the coffee mug, it all got out of control. Fuck you bitch.
</p>

<p>
Roy  got himself  a bottle  of vodka,  from the  store near  the
coffeehouse.   Oh he  wanted  to  say hello  to  her.  Fuck  you
bitch. He  reached the  apartment and started  drinking. Ordered
Pizza, kept drinking. He didn’t even remember when the pizza boy
came.
</p>

<p>
Halfway to the bottle he reached  the balcony and lied there for
good three  hours, the slices  settled him  in and just  when he
started  feeling little  bit sober  again.  He  got back  in the
apartment. He  finished the half  bottle in the next  hour. Fuck
you bitch.
</p>

<p>
Then  it was  haze, in  his  dreams Roy  was with  Riya for  the
vacation  she always  wanted. At  Maldivs, her  slaying the  red
bikini he  got her. Him in  the havaain shirt and  cotten shorts
below. And when she came back  running from the sea all was gone
and it was  all haze and blurred and dark  again.  As if someone
was tapping him on his ears.
</p>

<p>
There was no  point get going on the running  track.  The bloody
alarm didn’t  think so.  He  opened his  eyes and stared  at the
alarm seating beside  his photoframe.  It hadn’t  lost its shine
over the  past two years.  Same couldn’t  be said &#x2026;   Fuck you
bitch.
</p>

<p>
Roy got on  his feet and hurried to his  wardrobe.  He threw one
tshirt  and  a  trackpant  on  his shoulder  and  got  into  the
bathroom. When  he came out,  he was all  ready.  He put  on his
shoes.   His hand  stopped at  the door  knob and  he remembered
something he  got back  and tied  the fitness  band on  his left
wrist.
</p>

<p>
The band, Roy had bought on the next day when Riya left, it made
him  felt good  when he  was  up and  running the  next day.   A
productive day he  called and checked that on  the calender. The
same calender he  was looking at now, thirteen  days checked and
add two more. Half a month. Fuck you bitch.
</p>

<p>
Roy turned the knob and opened the door. He gasped when he saw a
figure which  looked like a  girl, her  hairs were thick  in the
pool of  the blood which  strayed along  the door. “Oh  &#x2026;” The
blood was down to the door and had touched the rim around it.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he froze and  few hazy pictures flashed in front of
his eyes.  They were real, the sound was real but they wiped off
his eyes so quickly he couldn’t make what it meant.
</p>

<p>
He shut  the door behind  the body,  his running shoes  left the
prints on  the floor when  he headed to  the bed. He  didn’t see
it. Then his head started spinning, more than what it was before
when he was boozed. He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled out
his mobile.
</p>

<p>
Call the police, you fool. Call the police.
</p>

<p>
He didn’t. Instead he closed his  eyes and lied down on the bed,
with blood dripping from the shoes  on the floor. The dream came
back Riya  was running towards him  in the red bikini.   She was
laying  her hands  out  in  the air,  like  those old  bollywood
movies. Then  as if the  bikini was made  of some paint  the red
color flowed  down to her stomach,  down to her thighs.   And at
that  moment he  forgot  her  face.  What  she  looked like  you
fuck. Don’t you remember, you loved her. You asshole.
</p>

<p>
Roy jumped out of the bed and ran towards the door. He opened it
with a thump and looked at the  girl lying down on the floor. Oh
fuck, that hair, how could you forget her hairs.
</p>

<p>
He knelt forward  and turned her head in his  lap.  Her face was
dripped with the blood, but he knew  it was her.  Oh Riya &#x2026; Oh
you fuck.   Then suddenly he  felt something  on his arm,  as if
there  was wind  blowing  on and  off. The  hairs  moved on  his
arm. He turned her face and put a finger down below her nose. He
felt the warm breath coming out of her nose. Oh you moron.
</p>

<p>
“Help ”  Roy put  Riya’s head  with carefully  on the  floor and
screamed.  He  ran back  into the bedroom  and picked  his phone
up. RIYA.  The  call history popped out like a  needle but there
was no time  for it.  He dialed  108 and a stream  of tears came
rolling down his cheeks.
