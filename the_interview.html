<h1 class="title">The Interview</h1>
<p>
“Mr. Rahul, tell  me about yourself” A woman  who was constantly
smiling  at him  said.   Other  two were  busy  on checking  his
documents.
</p>

<p>
“ My  name is Rahul  Pradeepkumar Vaidya. I have  graduated from
Delhi  University, I  &#x2026;”   He began  introducing himself.   He
began  wondering  about  the  job he  was  offered  at  Emperial
Research Center. It was a hefty  sum they were going to pay. The
interviewer had said that he would  have to work seventy hours a
week. Rahul however, didn’t take it  as word. He thought the sum
is hefty,  he could work  around something like sixty  hours but
for the  money he  had said yes.   “ &#x2026;  from  which me  and my
partner concluded that  the cell structure in  blood was changed
during  the  evolution  to  accomodate the  erect  structure  of
human.” Rahul wanted to laugh when  he said the word ‘erect’ but
he didn’t allow  that on the face. He just  wanted to go through
in fun way.
</p>

<p>
“So you believe in darvinism  ?” Mr Avasthi asked. Although, the
question surprised himself, why did  he ask that. He didn’t care
if the  person believed  in darwin  or his  theories or  not. He
wasn’t going to get the job. Neither five seating outside on the
bench.  The  positions were already  decided. He and  Mr Avasthi
were seating on the chair,  taking two thousand grands per hour,
for  the remaining  candidates.  The  little fun  should suffice
thought Mr. Avasthi.
</p>

<p>
“&#x2026; And  the head in the  Royal Science society was  a catholic
pop, he  flung Charle’s argument  saying his ancestors  might be
monkies not theirs, and then &#x2026;”
</p>

<p>
Oh I  know all  this, don’t be  a smart ass.   Why don’t  I stop
him. Mr  Avasthi stopped him  and said. “Good,  I take as  you a
believer in the evolution rather than God &#x2026; I will like”
</p>

<p>
“Oh I do not believe evolution, it’s the god that made us” Rahul
said. He wanted fun too. That  was a mistake when he realized he
had  already mentioned  about the  research paper  on the  blood
evoultion in Apes to accomodate the erect posture.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Avasthi knew there was  something that could be used against
him. Something  had said while  giving introduction. Only  if he
had paid better  attention. “I don’t believe in  god. He doesn’t
exist” He said.
</p>

<p>
“We  believers in  god”  Rahul  paused for  a  moment and  added
“believes  that it  is okay  to  not believe  in god”  . It  was
sarcastic and  he could see on  the face of interviewers  but he
meant to be sarcastic.
</p>

<p>
“That  is arrogant,  Mr Rahul”  Kavya  said who  was dwelled  in
thoughts  of her  boyfriend. She  was  eager to  finish off  the
interview early  so, she can  get back to Vihar’s  apartment. Oh
she had  thought all the  fun. Kavya couldn’t believe  her peers
stretching the interviews.  Streching was  the last thing on her
mind, but the remark was uncalled for.
</p>

<p>
“Ignorance to other’s believes is rude” Rahul said. Actually his
father was right, you should go to interviews even after you got
the job.  This  was more fun than watching Tarak  Mehta with his
younger brother and eating chips made with double refined oil.
</p>

<p>
“Okay.   let’s move  on to  your  personality, do  you have  any
hobbies ?” Mr. Raina said.
</p>

<p>
“Well, in my  lesuire time, oh I do enjoy  being free. A popcorn
tub in  my lap” Although  when Rahul  said he was  picturing the
whole  scenario  in  different  setup. “And  a  television  with
Netflix subscription. Amazon is for cheap people.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you  not know that all  the movies on Netflix  are on Amazon
servers”  Mr.   Raina said.   All  the  interviewer by  now  had
understood  that the  person was  not interested  in taking  the
job. However, It was fun  and very interesting than the previous
candidate who had his shirt soaked with the sweat.
</p>

<p>
“And I  am saying  Netflix has more  movies, good  movies” Rahul
said. He doubted that Amazon would allow hosting movies on their
servers, was the definition of  rivals different in America. Who
cares when you have both. He thought about her girlfriend Meera,
who was  reluctant to  buy Amazon  Prime so  just she  could see
Dexter. All that  blood stuff, it was fantasy  world bullshit to
him. However, the  sex was good. That made up  for every killing
Dexter did.
</p>

<p>
“I say  you are ignorant  about the  facts” Mr Avasthi  said. He
looked  at  his  partener  and gave  him  doubtful  stare.   “An
Intelligent person like you should know things like this.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh I will  see KBC from now  on” Rahul said. Bang  !! the words
just  spurred out  of  his  mouth. Most  of  the  time, he  only
realized the  good answer  after leaving the  conversation. This
was one of  the swag moment, he imagined a  flying gogles and a
black cap with  something written on it settled on  his face. He
didn’t like golden chains.
</p>

<p>
Kavya was  sitting there restless,  she knew that they  were not
going to  select Rahul  for the job.   She realized  however, he
himself didn’t want  the job. Her peers (She  rarely called them
peers  - they  were bunch  of  douchebags) were  making fool  of
themselves. Kavya wouldn’t bear this  long. However, she was the
junior in the Hiring department. Who made them the boss she said
to herself.  “Cut  to the chase, you are not  here for the Job.”
She said at last.
</p>

<p>
“And you are not exactly here,  for hiring me or anyone else who
is waiting outside, getting nervous and sweating heavily. So you
better cut to the chase.” Rahul said.
</p>

<p>
“Others is no  buisness of yours” Mr Raina said  with anger. “We
will do what we have to do”
</p>

<p>
“He is  right” Kavya  said. “We should  be transperent  with our
candidates”
</p>

<p>
Mr Avasthi turned his chair to  his left and stared at Kavya. He
didn’t speak but it was this - Two months you had. I have twenty
years of experince. Shut the fuck up.
</p>

<p>
“What the hell, I am leaving.”  Rahul said when he couldn’t bear
the tension growing inside.
</p>

<p>
“Seat young man” Mr Avasthi said.  The words and the look on his
face didn’t match.
</p>

<p>
Rahul  stopped and  stood  there beside  the  chair.  “Okay”  he
mumbled to himself.
</p>

<p>
“You  know  who  you  are  ?”  Mr  Avasthi  said.   “You  are  a
hypocrite. You  are having fun  with yourself and telling  us to
shut  the scene.   I hope  it’s not  late for  the company  that
offered you the job.” He grinned his broad smile.
</p>

<p>
Rahul  lunged forward  with his  hand resting  on the  chair and
smiled. “I can’t hope that for this company. It’s already late.”
He walked out of  the room. Bang Two !! He  hoped there would be
Avenger  heros (except  the jumping  kid -  he is  too young  to
understand  the concept  of swag  -  better stick  to the  wall)
bowing  down  to him  in  the  lobby.   However,  it was  a  big
disappointment, they were sullen  faces with nervousness soaking
their dull shirts.
