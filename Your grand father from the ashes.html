“It was somewhere here ?” My  grandfather called me and said. It
was the days, when everybody had  began to ignore him. Every few
minutes he was forgetting something he had done a few moment ago
and  rememberes something  in  distant. How  he  had called  her
daughter,  my aunt,  Samita.  When  nobody listened  to him,  he
started speaking  to himslef, but  I doubted though.   He talked
like my aunt was there sitting  beside him. At first it was hard
to listen  to his hysteria, then  it got easier when  we started
ignoring him.
</p>

<p>
“ &#x2026; it was  here, you know I was in Nigeria,  It was hot sunny
day in  the mine.  We  were all working  like dog. Mr  Jacob was
stickler  with  lunch.  It  was  one  to  one  and half  in  the
afternoon. Nobody can take minute outside that &#x2026;”
</p>

<p>
My  grandfather  had  went  to  many  hardships,  he  had  three
children. My  father’s big  brother, my uncle  had been  died in
accident  when he  was seventeen  just six  months after  he got
married. Grandpa  allowed my  aunt to get  remarried and  saw to
that. But before all this he  himself has left grandma in India,
when he  ventured in Nigeria for  a job.  It was  ’59, India was
independent but  Nigeria wasn’t. He  thought he would get  a job
for a  manager there but all  you plan never works  out he often
said when he  was sane. He had  to work in coal  mine, which was
owned by some Britisher. The whites he called, at times he hated
them and  the next moment  he loved  them.  I suspected,  he was
always  like that,  even in  his yonger  days. Call  it sane  or
insane,  but he  might  not  be so  different  from  what I  was
listening to.
</p>

<p>
“ &#x2026;  The  red shine, it was same like  the Kohinoor.  I looked
around, everybody was  working their ass off. I  slipped into my
pocket and started working again. The sun was up to my head, but
all that day  I worked as if  I got cold, shivering  like a baby
&#x2026;”
</p>

<p>
“Now, where do you saw Kohinoor ?”  I asked.  He looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
That   was    perfect   question   to   throw    him   off   his
delurium. Sometimes, I enjoyed the  stories, hell they were more
creative than Bollywood movies. Other days, I pitied him, what a
fine young man he would have been in his early days.
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t  seen him but  read about it”  He said with  no doubt
creeping on his face. “The description matches” He paused and it
felt to  me he forgot what  he was talking about  before.  I was
wrong.
</p>

<p>
“Mr. Jacob saw me, I was looking miserable, it might have been a
fever, he might have thought” Grandpa started again exactly from
where  he  left. And  on  those  ocassion  I  felt that  he  was
perfectly  sane,  capable of  reasoning,  throwing  you off  the
guard. Those moments were rare though.
</p>

<p>
“ &#x2026; That he was kind and got me off the mine and sent me home,
it  was  a small  room  and  common  kitchen  that we  called  a
home. The diamond was still in my pocket when I was walking back
to the residences. Adit, If I allowed it might have jumped right
out of the  pocket but I had grabbed him  under my pocket.” Then
he grabbed  his dhoti and  realized there  was no pocket,  but I
nodded so he continued. “I grabbed  him tight. I opened the door
of my  room, I  was sharing  with a North  Indian. It  was funny
name. Anyway I  looked for a safe place to  put the diamond. But
there was none.  Every place  I thought seemed like accesible to
that North  Indian. It was mine,  nobody could take it.   It was
here somewhere &#x2026; I’d put down here &#x2026;” His voice was trailing
off.   It was  routine for  him,  the story  would end  abruptly
without any  climax of sort.  I  doubted though if I  let on the
story would never end, and won’t have a climax.
</p>

<p>
But I let  him on.  “You couldn’t  find a place in  your room in
Nigeria.” I put emphasis on Nigeria. But he stared at me as if I
pronounced it wrong.
</p>

<p>
“No I  found it, didn’t I  tell you.  It remained  in my pocket.
Always safe with me.  That  South Indian wasn’t reliable. He was
weird man.   Didn’t I tell you.   The six months after  that, it
remained  in my  pocket and  then I  got off  the coal  mine and
worked  at hospital  nearby,  they  needed a  handy  man. I  was
exactly  that.  There  was  some funny  buissness  going on  the
hospital. The doctors and patients looked  at me like I was some
kind of ghost.  Six months passed  and I got back to India.  The
situation  in  India  then,  had  improved a  bit.   I  got  job
somewhere,  I  don’t remember  but  I  remember  my boss  was  a
Punjabi. Was it a woman I don’t remember.” He tappered off again
and asked “Where was I ?”
</p>

<p>
“The diamond” I said with excitement even though I knew it was a
mere story.   Some charcters that  he mentioned they  were there
before, some weren’t.
</p>

<p>
“Oh It’s  somewhere if  only I  remember where  &#x2026;  It  was red
shining thing.”
</p>

<p>
“Wasn’t it in your pocket ?” I asked him with slight irritation.
</p>

<p>
“Why would I  do that, it was precious red  thing. In my pocket,
it could fell anywhere” He frowned. “It’s somewhere I’d put, the
red thing”
</p>

<p>
“Maybe you  forgot in Nigeria”  I asked  and I was  prepared for
another story.
</p>

<p>
“There are no diamonds in Nigeria,  it was coal mine alright” He
said. “And they call me insane” He whispered almost to himself.
</p>

<p>
This was all.  It was the  climax. My grandpa was hysterical and
that was the  climax. But how good storyteller  he was, ofcourse
until he forgot about what he was talking. He was hell good with
that, for a moment I almost believed that there was a diamond. I
stood up and began walking away.  I knew he would continue as if
I hand’t walked away. I felt pity for him.
</p>

<p>
“Bring me that photo of your grandma” He called me. “That one in
which she had wore a that yello dress”
</p>

<p>
How would I  know that is yellow. All the  photos of Grandma had
no color  in them. However, I  guessed which one he  was talking
about. But  I didn’t care, the  story of him meeting  my grandma
was getting  old. It was  mystery to me  how he told  that story
again and  again without  any mistakes. He  loved her  dear, and
maybe it  was her death  that had  lead him into  this hysteria.
Somewhere, in my mind, there was always thought peeping out.  If
he was dead and my grandma  was alive it would have been better.
Women  are tougher  than men  my  mother always  said. I  didn’t
believe her, but my grandma was indeed a strong character.
</p>

<p>
Grandma raised  three of  her children when  grandpa was  at the
coal mine in Nigeria. ‘Alright, your grandfather sent money, but
it was never  enough.  We were three,  and it was a  hell of job
for your grandmother to raise us’  My father always told me.  He
thought he would teach me  value of responsibility.  But I never
understood before the  time. Noone does. He was  right about the
Grandma though.   She was tough lady,  she even bear loss  of my
uncle with smile on her face when others couldn’t cope with it.
</p>

<p>
“Nobody  in this  house listens  to  me” Grandpa  yelled. I  was
already  in my  room against  my study  table. ‘Alright,  Pa! My
exams are next  week and stories for next time’  I almost wanted
to yell  but didn’t.  I  rose from my  seat and walked  upto the
hall.  His  face was red  with anger.  If  I didn’t get  him the
photo, I  knew what I  would get. I have  to stay at  the dinner
alone with my father. A hearing he called.
</p>

<p>
I brought a chair and climbed  up. It was kind of tradition, the
elders on right and to the left  I found myself with my hands on
a ballon  ball.  That was  my favourite.  Anyway, I  unhiged the
photo in which Grandma was  standing against a coconut tree, the
place where now a new cinema  house was getting built. The photo
was  black and  white. But  the descriptions  Grandpa told  were
vivid, and I saw the yellow dress alright.
</p>

<p>
I handed  him the photo.  What  the hell, anyway It  wasn’t hard
passing an exam.  I  waited for him to start but  what I saw was
very unusual. His  eyes was turning watery as he  was looking at
the photo.   He always seemed  in good  spirit even when  he was
talking  about his  late  wife.   On those  days,  I doubted  he
remembered Grandma  getting sick and  leaving the world  and him
alone. He talked about granma as  if she was alive, and we can’t
just see her.
</p>

<p>
Grandpa  wiped  his   eyes  and  took  the  photo   out  of  the
frame. Behind the paper there was a letter. I had never seen the
letter before . It was so unusual of him to keep a secret letter
behind Grandma’s photo or hell any  photo. I was curious and for
a moment  wanted to snatch it  away from his hand  but I didn’t.
He didn’t  give me  a chance. And  in next moment  it was  in my
hand.
</p>

<p>
“Read it, Adi” He said. “I wish  I could read”.  Oh, I forgot to
tell you but he has almost  lost his near vision. In pictures, I
could recognize face  Grandpa had said. I  doubted that. Reading
was hard for him though, we  were both sure about it. There were
times, when  I liked reading  newspaper to him and  listening to
his comments  about politics, sports, the  old bollywood actors.
Though, now it was all blabbering after the hysteria.
</p>

<p>
The writing seemed faint on the  slight yellow piece of paper. I
pulled it closer, so I could read it clearly.
</p>

<p>
‘Dear, Adit,
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this, I am probably dead.’
</p>

<p>
It’s too filmy I thought and a laugh came out.
</p>

<p>
‘I left  your father  a will, but  this is for  you. I  may have
talked about working at coal mine  in Africa, but for a month or
so I worked  for a comapny that was mining  diamonds.  I hate to
say this  loud but I  stole one from  there and I’ve  brought it
here.   It was  shining red  in color.   It’s for  you and  your
aunt. The other letter I will have for your aunt.
</p>

<p>
Your grandfather,
from the ashes.’
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t think you  had funny bone ?” I whispered to myself.
</p>

<p>
“What does it  say” He said.  It said many  things Grandpa. That
you were  delusional way  before Grandma  died. That  this funny
letter didn’t  mean anything. That  you loved your  grandson and
your daughter very much.
</p>

<p>
“It’s letter you had sent Grandma from Nigeria” I said. “You are
saying it’s alright,  you have got a job at  the Hospital. Those
things.”
</p>

<p>
“Actually I never  sent her the letter” Grandpa  sighed. “I kept
it for myself. Your grandma didn’t know how to read. So I didn’t
sent it”
</p>

<p>
“Somebody could have read it to her” I said.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t  send and  anyway I  got back  in six  months” Grandpa
said. I  felt that he was  tired of the sudden  rush of emotions
so, I took the letter and  fold it behind the frame. Hinged back
the photo  to original place and  laid him down on  his bed. The
eyes looked pale and old. For a moment I thought he passed away,
but the  thought was  too filmsy  and he  didn’t. He  just slept
calmly until the next hysteria.
</p>

<p>
When I  got back to my  bedroom, the words from  the letter came
back puzzling me. There was no doubt  in my mind that it was all
delusional but a thought you can call it a doubt, what if it was
all true.  What  if there was infact a red  diamond somewhere in
the house,  although the  chances were less  as my  mother would
have found it  first as she was stickler for  cleaning the house
every six months. But what if  there was a another letter at her
aunts.   Then I  discarded all  thoughts  and fixed  my eyes  at
Newotinian differential method.

<p>
When I was staring at that picture another day, I remembered all
the stories  which my  grandfather used to  tell, some  real and
some of them his mythical  adventures. The last story, which had
my grandfather  in tears was  I thought the most  hysterical one
and yet I wanted to know more.  One day, even I asked my aunt if
she was  having any  letter that was  given my  grandfather. She
didn’t  remember any,  but  then  again I  knew  how her  memory
was. It was the same as her late father. Sometime immaculate and
on other occasions hysterical. I didn’t pursue more.
</p>

<p>
Then on  one evening when,  my father looked in  relatively good
mood, I had in myself to ask the question.
</p>

<p>
“Aakash, I  will tell you last  time” My father felt  the rim of
the spoon while  eating the icecream and said. “You  ought to do
better, he was the hysterical one”
</p>

<p>
I anticipated that however I wanted  to pursue more as there are
hardly any days, when my father answered my question without any
visible irritations. Yes, his face was the telling one. “I know,
dad. It’s just that it looked like  a real one and I felt that I
should understand as it was his last one”
</p>

<p>
My father never was the thinking  one, he always spoke his mind.
Never too late, always right in your face. This time however, he
stared at  me and not in  any anger ridden eyes,  but thoughtful
which I had lost hope on. “Really,  Aakash do you think we had a
diamond in our house ?” He  again took a scoop from the icecream
can.
</p>

<p>
“You would  have been eating this  daily and not on  Sundays” He
said with a gentle smile.
</p>

<p>
“What if he had a diamond” I said.
</p>

<p>
“And he  had hidden somewhere”  My father finished  the sentence
and then looked  at my mother who had already  finished her meal
and  was   the  leat  interested  in   these  Sunday’s  icecream
ritual. “Do you think Shivi, you wouldn’t have found?”
</p>

<p>
He stopped licking the spoon and gave a thoughtful look to Shivi
and then laughed hysterically “Ofcourse you sent it your mother,
didn’t you Shivi?” He said.
</p>

<p>
“Stop  Nim” My  mother said  and  started smiling.   It was  the
romance  that  went   on  between  my  parents   that  I  didn’t
understand. It was there present  only at the most inappropriate
moments.  Even  at the  funeral of  my grandfather,  they looked
relieved and cheerful  when it came to end. I  noticed there was
something going on between them,  I could look directly in their
eyes and see they were syncing  on. And yet on days of occasion,
like their  aniversery, it  was completly  opposite, a  cake and
then  nothing everybody  went  to their  room  like nothing  new
happened.
</p>

<p>
I was now losing interest in the diamond story.
