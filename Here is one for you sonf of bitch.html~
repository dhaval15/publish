<p>
“Wouldn’t you  ?” Neena  asked, who  sat infront  of him  took a
glass and raised.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t” Deepak said.
</p>

<p>
“Now  that’s  silly, I  couldn’t  remember  any of  my  birthday
without a drink”  Alisha said.  She had already  engupled two or
three from her glass.
</p>

<p>
“Even when  you were  kid” Kevin  said and put  his hand  on her
shoulders. She didn’t  mind. She wouldn’t have  when her stomach
was full of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
“It didn’t occured to me that’s  all, now I fear that it’s bad.”
Deepak said. He shrieked a little when his lips touched the cold
edge of the coke bottle.
</p>

<p>
“Who told you so?  your dad!  ” Rakesh said from the kitchen. He
was seating on the kitchen pouring the second round of the drink
into the glasses.  Apperantly he had finished his first one.
</p>

<p>
“Take na!” Neena snached the coke  bottle from his hand and went
on nagging him. “Try this one, this is all water, only a drop in
it” Deepak  liked her, he liked  her way of nagging.   It hadn’t
that mocking or humiliating quality that all other intended.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t  know” Deepak  said in  a low  voice hoping  that noone
wouldn’t hear. It seemed nobody heard him but Neena and she took
a sip and then passed on to him.
</p>

<p>
Deepak looked at the glass, he could see the faint lipstick mark
on the edge, he couldn’t resist getting a taste of it and raised
the  glass to  his lips  and looked  over the  table, it  seemed
everybody was on their second  one and hadn’t noticed this trade
between them.  He drank a little or it seemed to him that it was
little,  later  he realized  that  it  was  not how  one  drinks
decently.  The alcohol had that  bitter taste he had read about,
but the  notion practically touching  her lips took over  and he
didn’t feel any  bitterness afterwards.  As he  was enjoying the
smell of his lipstick he could feel her eyes observing him, when
he  looked at  her, she  smiled and  asked for  the glass  back.
Deepak didn’t wanted  to do that, he wanted that  feeling of her
lips before it dried out.
</p>

<p>
“It was too much, this is not how you drink, you take a sip, and
wait till you  enjoy it” said Neena while taking  the glass from
his  hands, she  purposefully  touched his  fingers while  doing
that.  “Like this” and then she  took a tiny gulp. She slide the
glass back to the opposite side.
</p>

<p>
Deepak  picked  up with  swiftness  this  time,  the sort  of  a
bartendener would with an empty glass. He rotated the glass over
and  took a  sip, he  could smell  that warm  breath of  her, he
couldn’t resist  himself taking another and  then another, until
she snached it back.
</p>

<p>
“You are crazy” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
He  could feel  his breath  getting  warmed, it  seemed she  had
warmer breath than his. It was  getting warmer and warmer in his
throat and  he enjoyed it for  a moment until he  could feel the
burning sensation. “It’s burning” Deepak  said. He felt his neck
with his hand.
</p>

<p>
“It supposed to  do that, it would have been  warmer rather than
burnt  if you  had followed  me” Neena  said. “Continue  on your
coke” She passed the bottle back to him.
</p>

<p>
Deepak  looked  at her  once,  her  face looked  beautiful,  but
fainting as he tried to focus  on her lips. “Neena, I am feeling
I would vomit” he said  rather loudly. They hadn’t realised that
were talking with very low voice before.
</p>

<p>
“What did you do ?” said  Rakesh and stared at Deepak. He looked
like his head was hit with a rod. “Are you drunk ?”
</p>

<p>
“I am drunk alright” said Deepak.  Neena got up and moved beside
him and held him by shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Who gave him ? He isn’t  supposed to drink.” said Rakesh. “ His
dad had took his  sign if he drank he wouldn’t  get a penny from
the company”
</p>

<p>
“The company can go to hell”  said Deepak. Neena took him to the
washroom.
</p>

<p>
Rakesh could hear the gulping sound from the bathroom, he looked
against the  table.  Krup  was licking  the glass,  twriling his
tongue all over  the edge. Rakesh amused himself  looking at him
and when he couldn’t resist but ask. “In god’s name what are you
doing ?”
</p>

<p>
Krup  tried to  say something,  but the  words came  out like  a
puzzle. His tongue was still surfing the rim of the glass.
</p>

<p>
“Take that tongue out of the  glass and then speak.” said Rakesh
rather loudly.
</p>

<p>
“I am feeling her lips” said Krup taking his tongue out and then
went back to what he was doing earlier.
</p>

<p>
“Who that would be ?” asked Alisha out of curiosity.
</p>

<p>
“Shriya Mam” said Krup.
</p>

<p>
Rakesh started  laughing and then  others joined him,  Deepak in
the bathroom could hear the laugh going on in the hall.
</p>

<p>
“They are laughing  on me &#x2026;” said Deepak looking  at Neena who
was still standing against the door.
</p>

<p>
“They might be”  said Neena. She felt that it  was her fault and
her  persistance had  lead him  to drink  the whole  glass in  a
single gulp. “If you haven’t had the whole glass by yourself”
</p>

<p>
Deepak threw again  and when he felt his mouth  was clean enough
to  speak, without  looking at  her he  said.  “You  can go.   I
shouldn’t stop you from enjoying yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s  okay Deepak,  I will  stay here”  said Neena,  she didn’t
wanted to leave him alone. “Looks  like it’s all out” before she
could complete the sentence, he threw again.
</p>

<p>
“I am telling you go, I will be there in five minutes, I have to
pee.” said Deepak.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, okay” Neena left the bathroom immideatly.
</p>

<p>
When she  was back in the  hallway, Rakesh was the  only one who
looked  sober, he  always  remained sober  after  even dozen  of
drinks or it  seemed so. Kevin and Alisha were  lying their head
on the  table and looking  at eachother talking  gibberish. Krup
had his forehead stamped on the table.
</p>

<p>
“What happened to him ?” asked Neena.
</p>

<p>
“He is dreaming and in between  talking gibberish, to which I am
too  busy enjoying  myself” said  Rakesh. Neena  could feel  the
words stumbling  from him.  She  took her original place  on the
table and waited for a sleep or Deepak whoever came earlier.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately she couldn’t sleep  after hearing the out-gulps from
the bathroom.   Soon, Deepak appeared  in front of  the bathroom
door, he  looked tired. He  walked up to  the table and  not for
once he did tried to meet Neena’s eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Happy Birthday” said  Neena even though she  had wished earlier
on the phone. There was gentle smile over her face.
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t  seems happy  to me,  it’s all  vomit, I  ruined the
evening for you all.” said Deepak and glanced at the three heads
lying on the  table. “Not all, these looks dead”  When he looked
at Rakesh,  he could tell  that he was  dead too, just  with his
eyes open. “Are you asleep ?” Deepak asked.
</p>

<p>
“I am not,  but I am feeling  like it” he said  with dead voice,
the emotion  had lost  long before the  party when  Sangeeta had
rejected him.
</p>

<p>
Deepak  had invited  Sangeeta  and then  Rakesh  called him  and
explained the whole  situation. He did feel bad  for both Rakesh
and Sangeeta.   They would have  been a great couple,  both were
straight  in  the face.   He  couldn’t  understand why  she  had
rejected him outrightly.  Then he  remebered the girl who nagged
him for  a coffee with  her he  had rejected.  Just  an Espresso
nothing  more.  She  would have  been same,  bitter as  Espresso
Deepak wondered.
</p>

<p>
“I am going to the balcony” said Rakesh and left the house.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t spill the  ash outside” said Deepak, but he  could see he
hadn’t listened him.  Deepak moved  his eyes over Neena, who was
still looking at him awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
“Sorry,  I  ruined  your  evening”   said  Deepak  to  ease  the
awkwardness.
</p>

<p>
“It’s your day Deepak, maybe I had ruined”
</p>

<p>
“It’s okay” Deepak  sat on the chair and  smiled remembering how
he gulped the whole glass. “So you won’t drink now ?”
</p>

<p>
“No,   I  don’t   feel   like  it”   said   Neena  with   slight
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s go outside, we can walk over to the coffee house.” Deepak
rose and headed towards the door.
</p>

<p>
“What  about these  chums, we  shouldn’t leave  them here”  said
Neena even though she had stood up from the chair.
</p>

<p>
“Rakesh is there,  no worry, he is an owl”  said Deepak. For the
first time in his life he felt grateful of Rakesh.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s go” Neena said and left the door. Deepak followed her and
soon  they  were walking  under  the  street.  She  was  looking
beautiful but when she didn’t, wondered Deepak and looked at his
shirt, there were  few spills of warm vomit on  it.  He tried to
scratch it,  they were  still filled with  moisture, so  he left
them alone and walked along.
</p>

<p>
“I like  you” said  Deepak as  he kicked a  pebble lying  on the
ground. The  pebble flung in  the air and stopped  hundred yards
away from their. His eyes never averted from the pebble wobbling
on the concrete road.
</p>

<p>
“I know” said Neena. Although she  had not expected he would say
out of nowhere. Then what was out of nowhere, she wondered.  She
liked that he  said it.  Ot was long overdue,  and couldn’t have
waited more. “I like you too”
</p>

<p>
For a while neither of them spoke. Neena knew it was mutual from
the get go, but  when they said it loud, first  she felt shy and
then felt awkward, she wondered he felt the same. She gathered a
little courage and asked, “What do  you like ?”  A moment later,
she felt stupid, thinking what that question achieves.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know” He said little. Neena felt relieved listening his
voice,  and  then  she  asked   herself  what  she  liked  about
himself. He  was rich that  was one  thing, other than  that she
couldn’t find anyother reason. She hated that thought and cursed
her why she had thought that  in first place.
</p>

<p>
“I like your eyes, how they glitter” said Deepak after a thought
and then asked the same question to her.
</p>

<p>
Neena remained silent.  Few seconds  before she had no answer to
the question, but when he asked  she had quite many. “Your eyes,
how deep they are”
</p>

<p>
“Seriously” said  Deepak and started laughing  out. Neena didn’t
liked it, he wasn’t supposed to  make fun of her. “My father say
they are of evil” he kept on laughing.
</p>

<p>
“Is that funny ?” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
“If you  were in my  position, it is”  said Deepak but  he could
look  that  it  wasn’t  a  moment  for  a  laugh.   He  resented
himself. “Sorry, I couldn’t resist”
</p>

<p>
They had reached the cafe, the cafe was empty beside a girl with
a green  tainted hair was  drinking coffee. They passed  her and
sat in the middle. They ordered two cups of coffee and waited.
</p>

<p>
Deepak couldn’t understand what to  say next, he could have said
anything, if he hadn’t confessed what he felt. They were friends
for longtime, but for next few  minutes it seemed like they were
total strangers seating on the same table. Looking at each other
awakwardly. Deepak didn’t want to upset her.
</p>

<p>
Neena was seating  right against him, most of time  they used to
seat besides, but  this time without realizing  they sat against
each orher. She  was feeling same nervousness, for  a moment she
couldn’t  understand  why  he  had  confessed  out  of  nowhere.
Everything   was   alright   before,   they   can   flirt   with
eachother. They  knew they liked  eachother, why he  did mention
that out  loud.  Then  again, she  felt that  he was  right, and
telling her was the right thing.
</p>

<p>
“Are you  upset ?”  said Deepak  at last.  He couldn’t  bear the
silence growing.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing, it’s just awkward when you said it” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
“Exactly, when it was out there  loud, I felt like I had nothing
to talk  with you” said  Deepak, he  felt relieved that  she was
feeling th same.
</p>

<p>
“I hope that will go away”
</p>

<p>
“It will go  away” said Deepak and paused for  moment. “You know
Sangeeta put Rakesh off the line”
</p>

<p>
“It was bound to happen”  said Neena. “Everybody knew Rakesh was
after and they aren’t meant for eachother.”
</p>

<p>
“I thought they would have made  a great couple” said Deepak. He
liked the fact they were talking like they ever did.
</p>

<p>
“I doubt that, they are so simmilar”
</p>

<p>
“That also”  said Deepak  although he  doubted that  notion. “He
isn’t taking that lightly”
</p>

<p>
“Nobody  does” Neena  started  drinking the  coffee that  waiter
brought.   Deepak  liked her  coffee  hot,  while she  liked  it
cold. Neena  doubted that Rakesh  had feelings for  Sangeeta, he
always  seemed like  he should  have girlfriend  not the  actual
feelings. She knew that after few drunk days the bitterness will
ease out.
</p>

<p>
“I know  what will happen though,  he would drink more  and more
now” said Deepak taking a sip from the cup. It was not much hot,
how he liked.
</p>

<p>
“How would green  look on me ?” asked Neena  looking at the girl
they had passed by.
</p>

<p>
“Green,  I don’t  know, maybe  orange ?”   Deepak squinted  from
corner of his eyes and said.
</p>

<p>
“Yuck, orange  won’t look  nice” said Neena.   How in  the world
orange would seat with the face. “Maybe you should do orange”
</p>

<p>
“I like white” said Deepak just to tease her.
</p>

<p>
“Why, you  know I don’t like  old guys” said Neena  and flinched
her lips.
</p>

<p>
“That’s why”.
</p>

<p>
Neena knew  he was pulling her  leg, some other time,  she would
have  got  irritated over  the  remark  but  she liked  it  this
time.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Rakesh was  staring in the dark  down the street, there  was dog
barking  loudly, but  he couldn’t  see  where it  was.  It  felt
irritating  to Rakesh,  he had  already taken  too many  drinks,
although he had reputation of  steady drinker, he even felt this
was more. And the fact, that he had to drink alone made him more
suspicious that he would throw up anytime. He looked back in the
hall, the three heads were still lying on the table.  What waste
of a  party he wondered.  He  was happy that Deepak  was getting
along with  Neena, he rooted  for them being together,  he liked
the  fact that  they never  overloaded their  groups with  thier
feeling, that was  thing he didn’t like about  the other couple,
Kevin and  Alisha. He knew for  sure that Alisha will  leave him
hanging sometime.  Krup he can get along, he liked him, he meant
he  spoke. Although  when he  was  drunk and  starts to  blabber
random thoughts out  in the public, he felt sorry  for him. When
Neena had came back from the  bathroom, he could see in her that
same feeling for him, he didn’t like it much. He didn’t care for
Neena as much as he did for  Deepak, but that sorry eyes for him
he couldn’t  bear.  He  was not  supposed to  live under  a pity
eyes.   He would  tell her,  but then  he didn’t  want to  upset
Deepak.
</p>

<p>
He had  drunk the whole bottle  and he threw in  the dark hoping
that  it   would  hit  the   dog,  however  it  missed   him  by
miles. Although that  scared the dog and he ran  off in the dark
corner and stopped barking. Rakesh wished he had one more bottle
to throw  at him, but he  hadn’t. For getting, he  would have to
get up and that  he didn’t like much.  He stared  at the sky, he
tried to  find moon, but it  was probably on the  other side. He
leaned back  onto the chair  and lit  a ciggarate, that  was his
fifth in  trot. He  liked the ciggarate  between his  finger, it
gave him  sense of control,  which was  scarce for the  last few
days.  The  calmness took  over him, as  he started  taking deep
drags. He laughed over how he  had told his father he would quit
smoking, and  he did try for  a month, but then  he was restless
that month.
</p>

<p>
The dog started  barking again, this time he was  under a street
lamp, and he could clearly see  him. He shouldn’t have, he would
regret this time. He rose and moved into the hallway and brought
back whole  the coke bottles,  Deepak had saved for  him. Deepak
liked drinking  coke, he didn’t  drink until that day.   A woman
could lead  you to  do anything he  wondered himself  and rushed
back to  the balcony, he was  raged. He lunged over  the railing
and threw the bottle downwards,  it missed him.  The dog started
barking even  louder, he was  challanging him. He  threw another
one, but the booze had taken  over him and before he realized he
was out of bottles. The dog kept on barking, there was nobody in
neighbourhood to care  for the barking or the  noise the bottles
made.  It seemed he was the  only one the dog aimed to irritate.
He was  getting enraged, he didn’t  like the dog a  bit.  He was
determined to kill him. He went  back to the hall and looked for
more  bottles, they  were there  but he  didn’t wanted  to loose
expensive alcohol for that silly  dog. He looked around if there
was anything in  the room.  He hoped that  Deepak’s parent might
have hid some rock in the  house, but they hadn’t. He opened the
bedroom which  seemed like  it was his  parents’. He  opened the
drawer,  may be  he  find a  knife. That  notion  rushed him  to
kitchen, there were  few knifes in the kitchen,  but they looked
small. That dog  wasn’t getting shut off over  kitchen knife. He
rolled back to the bedroom and ventured over the cupboard. There
were few suits and sarees lying in the cupboard.
</p>

<p>
“Who is making noise ?” said Krup from the hallway.
</p>

<p>
“Shut up” He shouted, when he  gone over thing in the drawer, he
stumbled upon  a pistol. That will  do it. He wanted  to go down
and shoot all of  the bullets in his head, but  he was tired and
impatient to go  by stairs. He rushed to the  balcony and looked
down the street the dog was still barking, he aimed for the dog,
he wasn’t going to move that son of bastard.
</p>

<p>
“Here’s  one for  you,  son  of the  bitch”  shouted Rakesh  and
started shooting with  the pistol. He emptied  the pistol before
he could hear a scream.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
“What are you  doing this vacation ?” said Neena  when they left
the cafe.
</p>

<p>
“I might  go along with  my father  to his office”  said Deepak,
scratching her pants. “He is nagging  me for year, I should take
some interest in the company, he says”
</p>

<p>
“I was planning to go somewhere” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
“We have planned a trip to Shilong, haven’t Alisha told you ?”
Deepak was surprised that she didn’t know about the trip.
</p>

<p>
“I know, I mean we two” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, where should we go ?” said Deepak.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t  know maybe  two days  off somewhere,  when they  go to
Shilong” said Neena.
</p>

<p>
“That might not seat well  with others” said Deepak, although he
was excited with the idea. “Maybe we can go alone in Shilong”
</p>

<p>
Neena nodded, she knew that if  they tried to get separated from
the group, Kevin and Alisha will too. She wondered how many days
were left in the semester, she couldn’t wait.
</p>

<p>
“Careful”  said  Deepak  when   Neena  stumbled  upon  piece  of
glass. He looked  around they were everwhere, he  picked one and
he realized  that it  was from  the bottles  of coke  and indeed
there was little spread around  on the street. They walked along
skipping the piecies.
</p>

<p>
Neena saw  a dog,  barking along the  street under  a glittering
lamp. She looked up on the fifth floor. Nobody was there. “I bet
he had thrown the bottles at the dog”
</p>

<p>
“No he wouldn’t”  Deepak defeneded Rakesh, but he  knew that she
was right.
</p>

<p>
“Who lives on this side of the building ?” asked Neena.
</p>

<p>
“Nobody, they are all empty, except Kavita ?” said Deepak.  They
stopped a distance away from the dog.
</p>

<p>
“Who is Kavita ?” asked Neena.
</p>

<p>
“Oh she is just girl lives on the floor beneath us.”
</p>

<p>
“Alone ?”
</p>

<p>
“No with the  family” Deepak could see the  gentle anger growing
on her face. “I don’t know others ? I mean the family”
</p>

<p>
Neena was staring at Deepak,  who was standing beside the street
lamp. Suddenly, the  dog started barking even  louder, she first
looked at the dog and then towards the balcony, Rakesh was there
lunging  on the  railing.  He  had  something in  his hand,  she
couldn’t see clearly.
</p>

<p>
“Here is  the one for you  son of bitch” he  spoke rather loudly
and  then   loud  noise  eruppted   as  if  some  kid   had  lit
firecrackers. Then  a scream  which chimed  in the  whole street
followed by another  this time it was high  pitched and muffled.
When Neena  looked at  Deepak, she saw  pool of  blood streaming
down his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Deepak” screamed  Neena and  rushed to Deepak,  he fell  on her
hand and she fell down on  the ground. He was breathing heavily,
but his face  was pale. He looked at her,  his eyes were looking
lifeless and he was trying hard  to keep them opened. She patted
on his chick, she wanted to scream for help but the words didn’t
came out from  her mouth. Atlast she screamed for  help, but she
wasn’t sure it was hers.
</p>

<p>
“I love you, Neena” said Deepak, the heavy breathing had started
to slow down. The voice seemed echoing away from distance.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t say it” Neena said and looked in his eyes, those were the
eyes  of someone  who had  seen everything  in their  eyes. They
looked pale  and old.  “I love  you too, Don’t close  your eyes”
Neena barely  gathered her voice  and said. “I love  you alright
and you are not going anywhere”
</p>

<p>
“Just look at me”
</p>

<p>
“I am here”
</p>

<p>
“The ambulance will be coming soon”
</p>

<p>
“Keep your eyes opened” She kept patting on his chick.
</p>

<p>
“I love you, Deepak” The tears came rolling down on her chick.
